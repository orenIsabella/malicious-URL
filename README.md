# malicious-URL
This research is our final project.
In our everyday life we manage personal risk and infer which
situations may be dangerous and avoid them accordingly. However, it
translates poorly to the context of the malicious URLs, there are few
effective heuristics to differentiate safe URLs from dangerous ones.
Internet criminals depend on the absence of such indicators to prey on
their marks. A simple URL can cause a lot of damage. The potential
harm is so great that malicious links are considered one of the biggest
threats to the digital world. Some of the most popular cyber attacks use
URLs for the attacks, such as C&C and phishing. Even though there
are a lot of studies conducted about the detection of malicious URLs,
there’s still a lot to discover especially about the weak spots of the
defense mechanisms. Since machine learning has become one of the
most prominent methods of malware detection, A robust feature selection
mechanism is proposed that results in malicious domain detection
models that are resistant to evasion attacks. This mechanism exhibits
high performance based on empirical data. This paper is meant to help
identify whether a link is malicious or benign. We rely on the thesis
written by Nitay Hason “Robust Malicious URL Detection”.We have tried
to find additional features to improve the accuracy of the URL detection,
and improved the scores of the classifier. Furthermore, it introduces
novel features that are robust to the adversary’s manipulation. Based
on extensive evaluation of the different feature sets and commonly used
classification models this paper show that models which are based on
robust features are resistant to malicious perturbations, and at the same
time useful for classifying non-manipulated data.
