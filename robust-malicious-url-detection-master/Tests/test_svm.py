# Support-Vector Machine (SVM):
#  is a learning algorithm that constructs a high dimensional hyperplane used 
# to solve the classification and regression problem. Given a set of training examples, and their associated 
# labels, the algorithm trains a model that assigns new examples to one label or the other, making it a 
# nonprobabilistic binary linear classifier. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently 
# perform a non-linear classification using a kernel trick implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional 
# feature spaces. A radial basis function (RBF) is a function that assigns a real value to each input from its 
# domain, and the value produced by the RBF is always an absolute value.
